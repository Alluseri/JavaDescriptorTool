# JavaDescriptorTool
A tool to parse Java descriptors and describe Java methods.

For some reason I couldn't find a tool like that on the web, so I decided to make one myself.

It's pretty flexible and passes some illegal cases, but it's not infinitely flexible so don't try putting a lot of spaces everywhere, it will break. Use it like a normal human being, come on.
# Command Line Arguments(why?..)
`-p`/`--parse` `[Descriptor]` - Immediately parses the given descriptor.

`-d`/`--describe` `[Method Signature]` - Immediately describes the given signature.
